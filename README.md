# Prototype

This is is a prototype for a financial data analytics company. Originally it was built using a mix of Sketch and UXPin to demonstrate organization and some transitions. After realizing the potential of Polymer JS, I chose to rebuld the entire prototype as an experiment and challenge. 

Still very much in progress...
